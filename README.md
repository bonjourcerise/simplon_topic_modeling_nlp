Topic modeling

Goal: Build a model capable of predicting the topic of a text.

Bonus: sentiment analysis

Difficulty:

easy using supervised learning
medium using LDA (unsupervised learning)
hard using Word embedding (Word2Vec) and t-SNE

Dataset:
Research papers: use the dataset to predict the topic of a scientific paper using its abstract. First, create a model using the tags (supervised learning). then, try to use unsupervised learning techniques to find topics and compare these topics with the tags of the dataset
